 * You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount.
 * Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.
 * If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
 * return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)
 *
 * Example 2:
 * coins = [2], amount = 3
 * return -1.

 * Note:
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
